## ft_printf
***The aim of this project is to recode the printf function from the C Library.***

In this project, you can learn how to use variadic arguments. More importantly, you can challenge yourself to structure the code well, so it can be extended to different usecases.

## Technical considerations

- Allowed functions: ```malloc```, ```free```, ```write```, ```va_start```, ```va_arg```, ```va_copy```, ```va_copy```
- All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary
- It will manage the following conversions: ```cspdiuxX%```
- It will manage any combination of ```-0.*``` flags and minimum field width with all conversions
