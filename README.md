## ft_printf
***The aim of this project is to recode the printf function from the C Library.***

In this project, you can learn how to use variadic arguments. More importantly, you can challenge yourself to structure the code well, so it can be extended to different usecases.

## Technical considerations

- Allowed functions: *malloc*, *free*, *write*, *va_start*, *va_arg*, *va_copy*, *va_copy*
- All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary
- It will manage the following conversions: *cspdiuxX%*
- It will manage any combination of *-0.** flags and minimum field width with all conversions
